abstract={Multi-agent simulation (MAS) has attracted significant attention for the prevention of pedestrian accidents and the spread of infectious diseases caused by overcrowding in recent years. In the MAS paradigm, each pedestrian is represented by a single agent. Control parameters for each agent need to be calibrated based on pedestrian traffic data to reproduce phenomena of interest accurately. Furthermore, observing all pedestrian traffic at large-scale events such as festivals and sports games is difficult. In such cases, parameter optimization is essential so that the appropriate parameters can be determined by solving an error minimization problem between the simulation results and incomplete observed pedestrian traffic data. We propose a benchmark problem, namely MAS-Bench, to discuss the performance of MAS parameter calibration methods uniformly. Numerical experiments demonstrate the baseline performance of four well-known optimization methods on six different error minimization problems that are defined on MAS-Bench. Moreover, we investigate the validity of the error function in the calibration by evaluating the correlation between the calibration and estimation scores. These scores are error functions relating to the available and unavailable observations, respectively.},

abstract = {Multi-agent crowd simulation is generally used to construct an environment suitable for reality by parameter estimation. This estimation is to modify a model defined by human movements and behaviors to fit real-world data by means of statistics or optimization [2, 11]. In the field of traffic engineering, for example, parameter estimation is used to modify speed models and collision models of pedestrians and vehicles [10, 13]. For different simulation settings, it is not easy to obtain original data of each real-world environment. Few existing estimation methods have been fairly evaluated. Therefore, there is a need for a benchmark to discuss the applicability of certain estimation methods to other use cases.},
